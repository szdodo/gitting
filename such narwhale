Narwhals, Narwhals
Swimming in the ocean
Causing a commotion
'Cause they are so awesome

Narwhals, Narwhals
Swimming in the ocean
Pretty big and pretty white
They beat a polar bear in a fight

Like an underwater unicorn
They've got a kick-ass facial horn
They're the Jedi of the sea
They stop Cthulhu eating ye

Narwhals
They are Narwhals
Narwhals
Just don't let 'em touch your balls
Narwhals
They are Narwhals
Narwhals
Inventors of the Shish Kebab

Narwhals
They are Narwhals
Narwhals
Just don't let 'em touch your balls
Narwhals
They are Narwhals
Narwhals

(Narwhals, narwhals)

Narwhals, Narwhals
Swimming in the ocean
Causing a commotion
'Cause they are so awesome

Narwhals, Narwhals
Swimming in the ocean
Causing a commotion
'Cause they are so awesome

Narwhals
Are really, really good
You'll find them in the sea 
They're never in the woods
Narwhals
You know they're just so sweet
They could stab you in the face 
With their long protruding teeth! Yeah!

It's a tooth
A tooth, tooth baby
They don't need a dentist 
'Cause they're washin' it daily

It's a tooth!
You know it's the truth!
You don't need no more proof
'Cause I'm telling you it's a tooth
